# Aurelia-Breeze Entity generator

TODO: Use [aurelia-dialog](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog) for dialog

## Bootstrap (Angular 1)

The `/bootstrap` folder contains the entity templates for jHipster using Angular 1 with Bootstrap, converted for use with Aurelia.

## Materialize

The `/materialize` folder contains the Materialize entity templates made for [aurelia-breeze-northwind](https://github.com/jdanyow/aurelia-breeze-northwind) demo.
Here we have sprinkled some initial template variables and loop constructs to make them dynamic.

## Way forward

We could use a mix of both approaches moving forward.
